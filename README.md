# 🚀 Mock Automation Framework

This is a modular and extensible automation testing framework built with Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG. It follows best practices like Page Object Model (POM), central configuration, utility reusability, and listener-based logging and reporting. Ideal for scalable web UI testing and CI/CD pipelines.
